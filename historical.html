        <p>The <u>Red Fort</u> or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic
             fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that
              historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
               Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on
                12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to
                 Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to
                  architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj
                   Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture
                    under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture
                     with Indian traditions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fort" target="_blank">more</a></p>

        <p>The <u>Charminar</u> (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in
             Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark
              is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem
               of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the
                existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years.
                 While both historically and religiously significant, it is also
                  known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the
                   structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist
                    attractions in Hyderabad.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charminar" target="_blank">more</a></p>

        <p>The <u>Hawa Mahal</u> is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built
             from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace,
              Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.
           The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh,
            grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of
             Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so inspired by the
              unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and
               historical palace.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawa_Mahal" target="_blank">more</a></p>
